# Langchain RAG Llama-Parse

Based on the pixegami/langchain-rag-tutorial project, langchain-rag-llama_parse adds several features. The main one is the implementation of Llama-Parse, which expands the range of documents accepted for data, previously limited to markdown files. Furthermore, the agent creation process (search databases) has been improved, as has the execution of prompts.

## Step-by-Step

Install dependencies.

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Configure Agents.py and create agents

```python
Agents.py
```

Configure run.py and run the agents

```python
run.py
```

You'll also need to set up an OpenAI and Llma Parse account (and set the keys on Agents.py and run.py) for this to work.
