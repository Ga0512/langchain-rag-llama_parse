Install dependencies.

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Configure Agents.py and create agents

```python
Agents.py
```

Configure run.py and run the agents

```python
run.py
```

You'll also need to set up an OpenAI and Llma Parse account (and set the keys on Agents.py and run.py)for this to work.
